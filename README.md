# pythonSocket Programming
## Simple Chat Application

##### I've created a program which allow you to chat on LAN via python3 socket.
##### This program allows to pre-define buffer-size of the data you are sending instead of predefied buffer-size which saves the bandwith!

## Usage:

#### python3 server.py -ht 127.0.0.1 -p 5000

* -ht : Host to Create
* -p : Port to bind
