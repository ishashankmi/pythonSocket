# pythonSocket Programming
## Simple Chat Application

##### I've created a program which allow you to chat on LAN via python3 socket.
##### This program allows to auto-define the buffer-size of the data you are sending, instead of pre-defied buffer-size which saves the bandwidth!

## Usage:

#### python3 [ server.py | client.py ] -ht 127.0.0.1 -p 5000

* -ht : Host to Create or Connect to
* -p : Port to bind
